# fish-ssh-agent Changelog

## 1.1.1 / 2021-06-03

- Fixed a bug with the detection of macOS.

## 1.1.0 / 2021-04-02

- Not all SSH keys include the filename when printed with `ssh-add -L`.
  Key discovery has been modified to compare identity bodies prior to
  considering identity filenames. This is slower but safer as it requires
  that we read the identityâ€™s public file for comparison.

- Improved default `ssh-add` flags.

- Removed dependency on halostatue/fish-utils-core.

## 1.0.1 / 2020-10-27
